- 👋# Hi, I’m @ibaenadi

👀 I’m interested in **network engineering, system virtualization, and containerization technologies**. With a passion for optimizing and securing IT infrastructures, I thrive on turning challenging technical issues into smooth-running systems.

🌱 I’m currently learning **advanced Kubernetes orchestration** to enhance my skills in managing and scaling containerized applications. I'm also deepening my understanding of **cloud-native technologies** and exploring **IaC (Infrastructure as Code)** tools like Terraform and Ansible.

💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on **open-source projects focused on network automation, Linux system management**, and **developing cloud-native applications**. I'm eager to contribute to tools that improve infrastructure efficiency and security.

⚡ Fun fact: Aside from my tech interests, I'm an avid hiker and love exploring trails. The complexity and resilience of nature inspire my approach to solving complex network and system challenges.
